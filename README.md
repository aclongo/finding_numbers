# finding_numbers
This is my solution for "Finding Numbers in a Haystack" from Chapter 11 of Python for Everybody.

The assignment was: "Write a program that can read through and parse a file with text and numbers. It should extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers."

How I went above and beyond:
<ul><li>Allowing user input of a text file name</li>
    <li>Using 'try' and 'except FileNotFoundError' to prevent the program from crashing with bad input</li>
    <li>Keeping track of the current line number</li>
    <li>Printing the numbers found with each line number</li>
    <li>Printing statements for the final count and sum of numbers</li>
